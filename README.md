# TelegramBot-ACC-Scraping
A personal project that intends to scrape information about current and planned water shutdowns by Apa-Canal Chisinau and display it when needed by user in Telegram Bot.

Work is still in process!


Prerequisites are:
*installing Telegram app
*register
*find bot by [botname](not assigned yet)


Steps of use:
*After pressing start, bot will greet you and will ask you what do you want to discover.
*Below that message will be two options [keyboard markup]- current shutdowns and planned shutdowns.
*When you choose Current shutdowns, it will display all shutdowns in that day. 
And will ask you if you want to subscribe to daily notifications of current shutdowns according your district(Buiucani, Centru, ...)

If user will subscribe, daily he/she/other will receive all data according to region in this form => Street + Street number, Hour + date of disconnection and connection.
Automatically after choice, bot will display all data. You will have the option to return in greeting menu.

*When you choose Planned shutdowns, it will display all planned shutdowns and link to that page on acc.md for further information, such as cause of shutdown.

The Scope of this project is to inform people, because in this highly tech times, a water shutdown can make you feel miserable and helpless. 
This idea come to my mind after I remained without water for 4 days without being informed in advance by house administrator.
